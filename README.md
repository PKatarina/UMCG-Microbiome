# UMCG-Microbiome
UMCG Microbiome does simple analyzes and graphs of metagenomical data and _bacterial pathway data_. 

## Content:
1. BiomTable_class: reading and parsing csv metaphlan
2. Data_chart: pie chart and bar chart of data groups
3. Diversity_class: calculating shannon, simpson and jaccard index from abundance
4. Box_plot: draws a box plot for a set of metaphlan data
5. PathwayTable_class: reading and filtered pathway abundance file
6. Test_script

7. Examples and database folder that can be used to try out the code

## Instructions
For analyzes of metagenomical data BiomTable_class opens Metaphlan files and is used in other scripts. 
Download this first. To use other scripts download it and get an appropriate example file. 
PathwayTable_class is only script that does an analyzes of bacterial pathway data.

To test out all scripts, open Test_script, and uncomment testing functions to test out scripts.
